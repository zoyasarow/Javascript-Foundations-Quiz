# Javascript-Foundations-Quiz

[Live Link](https://zoyasarow.github.io/Javascript-Foundations-Quiz/)

This Javascript Quiz uses HTML, CSS & Vanilla Javascript to do the following:
  * Begin the quiz with a 'start quiz' button that initalizes the quiz,
  * Uses an object array to cycle through and display questions and answer options (multiple choice),
  * Gives a correct answer after each answer option is selected,
  * Has a 'next' button that moves through each question
  * Has a timer that with each wrong answer/attempt, decreases in time
  * Keeps track of points earned and has a scorecard/score keeper
  * Prompts for quiz taker to submit name and record score at the end 
  * Has a "reset' button option to try again!
  * Because correct or incorrect answer messaging is set with an alert method, you cannot see it in the screen recording below- but it   is there!
  
  There are also areas that I am currently unable to figure out (some highlighted at end of screen recording)

     1). Cannot get final logged initials with score to center in quiz box at the very end (was created with document.createElement)
   
     2). Cannot get restart function to run (using window.location.reload() functionality)
   
     3). Printing alerts onto quiz when correct or incorrect answers are clicked (currently using alert method)
